  This example workflow shows a typical build, test, and deploy job in a single workflow. By adding the Sumo Logic Orb to the top of our config and including the provided "workflow-collector" job, analytics may be automatically reported to the CircleCI App for Sumo Logic. You must also setup the CircleCI App on Sumo Logic
